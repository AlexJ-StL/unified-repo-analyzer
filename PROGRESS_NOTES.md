# Task 5 Progress Notes - Test and Fix Runtime Functionality

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS

### Issues Identified and Fixed ‚úÖ
1. **Missing Import in Path Controller** - Fixed `validationResult` import from express-validator
2. **Excessive Logging** - Reduced metrics logging from every 5 minutes to every 30 minutes
3. **API Endpoints Working** - Backend APIs are responding correctly:
   - Settings persistence: ‚úÖ Working
   - Path validation: ‚úÖ Working  
   - Configuration management: ‚úÖ Working

### Current Issues Found üîç
From health check (503 status):
1. **Memory Usage Elevated** - 83.3% memory usage (degraded status)
2. **Missing Data Directory** - Filesystem and disk checks failing due to missing `./data` directory
3. **File System Errors** - ENOENT errors for health check files

### Frontend Components Verified ‚úÖ
- SettingsPage.tsx: Complete with form controls
- PathInput component: Full validation and error handling
- Settings store: API integration working
- Error display components: Comprehensive error handling

### Test Results
- Backend running on port 3000 ‚úÖ
- APIs responding but health checks failing ‚ùå
- Created test-runtime.js for systematic testing ‚úÖ

### Next Steps When Resuming
1. **Fix Data Directory Issue**:
   - Create missing `./data` directory
   - Ensure proper permissions for health check files
   
2. **Address Memory Usage**:
   - Investigate high memory consumption (83.3%)
   - Check for memory leaks or excessive caching
   
3. **Complete Health Checks**:
   - Re-run test-runtime.js after fixes
   - Verify all health endpoints pass
   
4. **Test Frontend Integration**:
   - Verify frontend can connect to backend
   - Test file path browsing functionality
   - Test settings persistence in UI

### Files Modified
- `packages/backend/src/api/controllers/path.controller.ts` - Added missing import
- `packages/backend/src/services/metrics.service.ts` - Reduced logging frequency
- `test-runtime.js` - Created comprehensive API test

### Key Finding
The "critical runtime functionality issues" appear to be primarily:
- Health check failures (fixable)
- Excessive logging (fixed)
- Missing directory structure (fixable)

The core functionality (APIs, settings, path validation) is actually working correctly!
