# Bun Process Management System

## Problem Statement

The project has been experiencing recurring issues with runaway Bun processes that consume excessive CPU resources. This has happened multiple times and requires a systematic solution.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Concurrent Process Spawning**: Multiple Bun processes running simultaneously
2. **Infinite Loops**: Test processes or scripts getting stuck in infinite loops
3. **Memory Leaks**: Processes not properly cleaning up resources
4. **Timeout Issues**: Long-running processes without proper timeout handling
5. **Process Monitoring**: Lack of automatic process monitoring and cleanup

## Solution Components

### 1. Process Manager (`scripts/fix-runaway-bun.ts`)

A comprehensive Bun process management system that:

- **Monitors** active Bun processes
- **Limits** concurrent process count (default: 3)
- **Kills** processes exceeding memory limits (default: 1GB)
- **Enforces** process timeouts (default: 5 minutes)
- **Logs** all process management activities

### 2. Background Monitor Service (`scripts/bun-monitor-service.ts`)

A continuous monitoring service that:

- Runs in the background
- Automatically detects and kills runaway processes
- Provides real-time process monitoring
- Handles graceful shutdown

### 3. Process Wrapper (`scripts/bun-wrapper.ts`)

A wrapper script that:

- Checks existing process count before starting new ones
- Enforces process timeouts
- Provides better error handling
- Prevents process accumulation

### 4. Configuration System

Configurable limits stored in `.kiro/bun-process-config.json`:

```json
{
  "maxConcurrentProcesses": 3,
  "maxCpuUsagePercent": 80,
  "maxMemoryUsageMB": 1024,
  "processTimeoutMs": 300000,
  "monitoringIntervalMs": 10000
}
```

## Usage

### Immediate Cleanup

```bash
# Clean up runaway processes immediately
bun run bun:cleanup

# Or directly
bun run scripts/fix-runaway-bun.ts cleanup
```

### Status Check

```bash
# Check current process status
bun run bun:status

# Or directly
bun run scripts/fix-runaway-bun.ts status
```

### Background Monitoring

```bash
# Start continuous monitoring
bun run bun:monitor

# Or run as a service
bun run scripts/bun-monitor-service.ts
```

### Setup Prevention System

```bash
# Set up prevention hooks and wrappers
bun run scripts/fix-runaway-bun.ts setup
```

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Process Limits

- Maximum 3 concurrent Bun processes
- Automatic cleanup when limit exceeded
- Memory usage monitoring (1GB limit)

### 2. Timeout Enforcement

- 5-minute timeout for all processes
- Automatic termination of long-running processes
- Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM, followed by SIGKILL

### 3. Resource Monitoring

- Real-time process monitoring
- CPU and memory usage tracking
- Automatic intervention when thresholds exceeded

### 4. Logging and Alerting

- All process management activities logged
- Historical data for troubleshooting
- Status reporting and alerts

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Package.json Scripts

The system adds these scripts to package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "bun:cleanup": "bun run scripts/fix-runaway-bun.ts cleanup",
    "bun:monitor": "bun run scripts/fix-runaway-bun.ts monitor", 
    "bun:status": "bun run scripts/fix-runaway-bun.ts status"
  }
}
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Consider adding process cleanup to pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# In .git/hooks/pre-commit
bun run bun:cleanup
```

### CI/CD Integration

For continuous integration:

```yaml
# In GitHub Actions or similar
- name: Cleanup Bun Processes
  run: bun run bun:cleanup

- name: Monitor During Tests
  run: |
    bun run scripts/bun-monitor-service.ts &
    MONITOR_PID=$!
    bun run test
    kill $MONITOR_PID
```

## Troubleshooting

### High CPU Usage

1. Check process status: `bun run bun:status`
2. Clean up processes: `bun run bun:cleanup`
3. Start monitoring: `bun run bun:monitor`

### Process Won't Die

1. Use the cleanup script with force option
2. Manually kill with Task Manager
3. Check for zombie processes

### Monitoring Not Working

1. Check log files in `.kiro/logs/bun-process-monitor.log`
2. Verify configuration in `.kiro/bun-process-config.json`
3. Restart the monitoring service

## Configuration Options

### Process Limits

```json
{
  "maxConcurrentProcesses": 3,    // Max simultaneous processes
  "maxMemoryUsageMB": 1024,       // Memory limit per process
  "processTimeoutMs": 300000      // 5-minute timeout
}
```

### Monitoring Settings

```json
{
  "monitoringIntervalMs": 10000,  // Check every 10 seconds
  "maxCpuUsagePercent": 80        // CPU usage threshold
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always run cleanup** before starting intensive operations
2. **Monitor during long-running tasks** like test suites
3. **Set appropriate timeouts** for your specific use cases
4. **Review logs regularly** to identify patterns
5. **Adjust limits** based on your system capabilities

## Emergency Procedures

### Complete System Lockup

1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. Find all "bun.exe" processes
3. End all Bun processes
4. Run `bun run bun:cleanup` to verify cleanup

### Persistent Issues

1. Restart your development environment
2. Clear Bun cache: `bun pm cache rm`
3. Check for system-level issues
4. Consider adjusting configuration limits

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Checks

- Review process logs
- Check system resource usage
- Verify monitoring service is running

### Weekly Maintenance

- Clean up old log files
- Review and adjust configuration
- Update process management scripts if needed

### Monthly Review

- Analyze process patterns
- Optimize configuration based on usage
- Update documentation and procedures

This system should prevent the runaway Bun process issue from recurring and provide tools for quick resolution when it does occur.
