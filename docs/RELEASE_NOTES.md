### 🔄 Migration Guide

This is the initial release, so no migration is required. For future versions, migration guides will be provided here.

### 🐛 Known Issues

#### Minor Issues
- Large repositories (>10GB) may require increased memory allocation
- Some binary file types are not analyzed (by design)
- WebSocket connections may timeout on very slow networks

#### Workarounds
- For large repositories, use the `--max-files` option to limit processing
- Binary files are intentionally skipped to focus on source code
- WebSocket timeout can be configured in the backend settings

### 🔮 Roadmap

#### Version 1.1.0 (Planned)
- **Enhanced LLM Providers**: Support for additional LLM services
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Dependency graphs and architecture diagrams
- **Plugin System**: Extensible plugin architecture for custom analyzers
- **Performance Improvements**: Further optimization for large repositories

#### Version 1.2.0 (Planned)
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user support with role-based access
- **Historical Analysis**: Track repository changes over time
- **Integration APIs**: Webhooks and third-party integrations
- **Advanced Reporting**: Custom report templates and scheduling

### 📈 Performance Benchmarks

#### Analysis Speed
- Small repositories (<100 files): ~5-15 seconds
- Medium repositories (100-1000 files): ~30-90 seconds
- Large repositories (1000+ files): ~2-10 minutes

#### Resource Usage
- Memory: 512MB - 2GB depending on repository size
- CPU: Optimized for multi-core processing
- Storage: Minimal storage requirements for analysis cache
