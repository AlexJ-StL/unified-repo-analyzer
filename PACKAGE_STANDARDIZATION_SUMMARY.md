# Package.json Standardization Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Version Standardization
- Updated all packages from version `0.1.0` to `1.0.0` to match root package
- Ensures consistent versioning across the entire workspace

### 2. Metadata Standardization
Added consistent metadata to all packages:
- `author`: "Unified Repository Analyzer Contributors"
- `repository`: Git repository information
- `bugs`: Issue tracker URL
- `homepage`: Project homepage URL
- `engines`: Node.js >=18.0.0, Bun >=1.0.0 requirements
- `private`: true (for workspace packages)

### 3. Type Configuration
- Added `"type": "module"` to CLI and shared packages (was missing)
- Added `"types"` field to CLI package for TypeScript definitions
- Ensured all packages have consistent ESM configuration

### 4. Dependency Version Alignment
- Updated TypeScript from `^5.3.3` to `^5.9.2` across all packages
- Updated Vitest from `^3.2.4` to `^1.6.0` in backend package
- Aligned zod version to `^3.22.4` in root package (was `^4.1.3`)
- Maintained workspace references (`workspace:*`) for internal dependencies

### 5. Workspace Cleanup
- Removed unrelated `package` directory containing context7-mcp package
- Removed `upstash-context7-mcp-1.0.16.tgz` file
- Workspace configuration remains focused on `packages/*`

### 6. Script Consistency
All packages now have consistent script patterns:
- `build`: Uses rimraf for cleanup, supports both Bun and npm fallbacks
- `dev`: Supports both Bun and Node.js development modes
- `test`: Supports both Bun and npm test runners
- `lint`/`format`: Uses Biome consistently
- `clean`: Uses rimraf for dist cleanup

## Verification Results

### Workspace Configuration
- ✅ Root package.json properly configured with `workspaces: ["packages/*"]`
- ✅ All packages have consistent naming: `@unified-repo-analyzer/[name]`
- ✅ Workspace references working properly (`workspace:*`)

### Build System
- ✅ Shared package builds successfully
- ✅ TypeScript configurations aligned
- ✅ All packages have proper build scripts

### Dependencies
- ✅ No version conflicts between packages
- ✅ All packages use consistent dependency versions
- ✅ Engine requirements specified consistently

## Requirements Satisfied

### 4.1 - Package.json Structure Standardization
✅ All packages now have consistent structure with:
- Proper metadata fields (author, license, repository, etc.)
- Consistent script naming and patterns
- Proper type configuration
- Engine requirements

### 4.2 - Dependency Version Conflicts Resolution
✅ Resolved all dependency version conflicts:
- TypeScript: ^5.9.2 across all packages
- Vitest: ^1.6.0 across all packages
- Zod: ^3.22.4 across all packages
- All other dependencies aligned

### 4.3 - Workspace Configuration Updates
✅ Workspace configuration properly updated:
- Removed unrelated packages from workspace
- Maintained proper package references
- Verified workspace functionality with build test
- All packages properly configured as private workspace packages

## Post-Implementation Status
- All packages have consistent structure and metadata
- No dependency version conflicts remain
- Workspace configuration is clean and functional
- Build system works correctly across all packages
