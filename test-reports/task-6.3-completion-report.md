**Generated:** 9/3/2025, 2:18:26 PM

**Overall Status:** ❌ INCOMPLETE

**Test Results:** 6/8 passed (75.0%)

## Test Results

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|----------|
| Intelligent Batching | ✅ PASS | Test batching and optimization working correctly |
| Selective Execution | ✅ PASS | Selective test execution properly implemented |
| Fast Feedback Loops | ❌ FAIL | Missing features: bun test integration |
| Execution Optimizer | ✅ PASS | Test execution optimizer working correctly |
| Cache and Metrics | ✅ PASS | Cache and metrics system properly implemented |
| Cross-Platform Compatibility | ❌ FAIL | Compatibility issues: scripts/selective-tests.ts: uses Unix 'find' command; scripts/fast-feedback.ts: still uses vitest instead of bun test; scripts/test-execution-optimizer.ts: still uses vitest instead of bun test |
| Performance Optimizations | ✅ PASS | Performance optimization reports generated successfully |
| Error Handling | ✅ PASS | Proper error handling and recovery implemented |
