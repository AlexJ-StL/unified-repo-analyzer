- **Features:**
  - Windows/Linux/Mac compatible path handling
  - Cross-platform file discovery using glob patterns
  - Bun test integration (replacing vitest for better compatibility)
  - Proper command execution with timeouts

### 8. ‚úÖ Comprehensive Reporting and Analysis
- **Output:** `test-reports/execution-optimization.md`
- **Features:**
  - Detailed execution plans with batch information
  - Performance metrics and recommendations
  - Usage instructions and optimization suggestions
  - JSON and Markdown report formats

## üìä Verification Results

### Test Execution Optimizer
```bash
bun scripts/test-execution-optimizer.ts optimize
# ‚úÖ SUCCESS: Discovered 117 test files, created 16 batches, estimated 301.2s duration
```

### Change Detection and Strategy Selection
```bash
bun scripts/test-execution-optimizer.ts quick
# ‚úÖ SUCCESS: Detected 10 changed files, selected "all" strategy
```

### Report Generation
- ‚úÖ Generated `test-reports/execution-optimization.json`
- ‚úÖ Generated `test-reports/execution-optimization.md`
- ‚úÖ Generated comprehensive completion reports

## üîß Implementation Details

### Intelligent Batching Algorithm
- Groups tests by estimated duration and priority
- Maximum 30 seconds per batch, maximum 10 tests per batch
- Priority calculation based on:
  - File modification recency
  - Package importance (shared > backend > frontend)
  - Test type (unit > integration > e2e)
  - File size and complexity

### Change Detection Strategy
- **All Strategy:** Run all tests (for large changes)
- **Affected Strategy:** Run only affected tests (for small changes)
- **Minimal Strategy:** Run fast, high-priority tests only (for no changes)

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel execution with configurable concurrency
- Smart test ordering (fast tests first)
- Resource-aware execution planning
- Caching of test metrics and dependencies

## üéâ Task Completion Status
